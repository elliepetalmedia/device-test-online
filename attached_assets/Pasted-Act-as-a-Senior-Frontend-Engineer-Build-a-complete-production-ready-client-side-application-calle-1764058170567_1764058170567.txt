Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer. Build a complete, production-ready, client-side application called "DeviceTestOnline".

1. FILE STRUCTURE
Create the following files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /pages/about.html
- /pages/contact.html
- /pages/privacy.html

2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
- Fonts: Use 'Orbitron' (headers) and 'Roboto Mono' (body) via Google Fonts.
- Icons: Use Phosphor Icons via CDN.
- Persistence: None required.
- Constraint: Client-side processing only. No audio recording is sent to servers (visualization only).

3. DESIGN SYSTEM (style.css)
- Theme: "Sci-Fi Dashboard".
- Colors: Background #0b0c10, Surface #1f2833, Accent #66fcf1 (Cyan), Secondary #45a29e (Teal), Text #c5c6c7.
- Layout:
  - Sidebar: Fixed width (250px), dark background, navigation links to tests.
  - Main Content: Flex area.
- UI Components:
  - Borders: 1px solid #45a29e with slight glow (`box-shadow`).
  - Typography: Monospace, technical look.
  - Indicators: LED style lights (Red/Green).

4. APPLICATION LOGIC (script.js)
Implement 4 distinct testing modules that toggle visibility based on Sidebar navigation:

A. Mouse Test
- Visualizer: A graphic of a mouse. Highlight Left, Right, Middle buttons on `mousedown`.
- History Log: List the last 10 events (e.g., "Left Click - 12:01:05").
- **Double Click Fault Detector:** Track timestamps of clicks. If two `mousedown` events on the same button occur within 80ms, trigger a RED Alert Banner: "Potential Double-Click Fault Detected".
- **Affiliate Logic:** If a fault is detected, unhide a div with ID `affiliate-offer`. Content: "Mouse switch failing? Recommended Replacement: Logitech G502".

B. Keyboard Test
- Visualizer: Render a full QWERTY layout using HTML/CSS grid.
- Logic: Listen for `keydown` events. When a key is pressed, change its background color to Green permanently (to show it has been tested/verified).
- Counter: Display "Keys Verified: X / 104".

C. Dead Pixel Test
- UI: A large button "Start Color Cycle".
- Logic: Trigger `element.requestFullscreen()`.
- Interaction: On `click`, cycle the background color through: Black -> White -> Red -> Green -> Blue.
- Exit: Press ESC to exit.

D. Microphone Test
- Logic: Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({audio: true})`.
- AudioContext: Create an `AnalyserNode` to get volume data.
- Visualizer: Map the volume level to the height of a CSS Bar or HTML5 Canvas waveform in real-time.
- Privacy Note: Display "Audio is visualized locally. No recording happens."

5. INDEX.HTML CONTENT
- Header: Logo "DeviceTestOnline", Subtitle "Hardware Diagnostic Suite".
- Sidebar: Navigation links (Mouse, Keyboard, Screen, Mic).
- Main: Container for the tools.
- SEO Article: Below the tool container, insert an `<article>` with this EXACT HTML content:
  """
  <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 4rem auto; padding: 0 1rem; color: #c5c6c7;">
    <h2>Diagnosing Mouse Double-Click Issues</h2>
    <p>One of the most common failures in modern gaming mice is the "double-click" fault. This occurs when the copper tension spring inside the microswitch degrades, causing a single physical click to register as two rapid electrical signals. Our tool detects this by measuring the milliseconds between signals; anything under 80ms is typically a hardware failure.</p>

    <h2>What is Keyboard Ghosting?</h2>
    <p>"Ghosting" happens when a keyboard cannot register multiple keys pressed simultaneously. This is critical for gamers and fast typists. Use our Keyboard Test to verify your N-Key Rollover (NKRO) capabilities by pressing multiple keys at once.</p>

    <h2>Checking for Dead Pixels</h2>
    <p>A dead pixel is a picture element that fails to change color. By cycling through primary colors (Red, Green, Blue) and extremes (Black, White) in full-screen mode, you can easily spot stuck or dead pixels on your monitor.</p>
  </div>
